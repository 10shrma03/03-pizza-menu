## Key Concepts

### Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App, a tool that simplifies the setup of a React application.

### Components and Component Tree

The application is built using a component-based architecture. Each part of the UI is a separate component, and together they form a component tree. 

### Props and State

Props are used to pass data between components, enabling reusability and modularity. State management is used within components to handle dynamic data and user interactions.

### Conditional Rendering

Elements are conditionally rendered based on the application state, providing a dynamic user experience.

### Return and ClassName

Each component returns a JSX structure that represents the UI. The `className` attribute is used to apply CSS styles to these elements.

### Separation of Concerns

The application logic is separated from the presentation logic, following the principle of separation of concerns. This improves code readability and maintainability.

### Rendering Lists and Destructuring Props

Lists are dynamically rendered using the `map` function. Props are destructured to simplify the code and make it more readable.
